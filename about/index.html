        <h4>About</h4>
        <p>Based out of Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Ryan Elliot Drew is an active performer and educator. As a teaching artist with the National Arts Centre’s Music Alive Program, Ryan has worked extensively on the development of a new approach to cross-cultural music education—one that is inclusive of PEI’s indigenous population. As the director of music with the Montessori School of Charlottetown, Ryan has adapted a music curriculum to the Montessori approach to early childhood development. He has also worked as a research assistant with AIRS (Advancing Interdisciplinary Research in Singing), a seven year initiative dedicated to understanding of the human voice’s role in cognitive development, and, he continues to manage a private studio of percussion and piano students. Ryan has been an active performer with ensembles such as the PEI Symphony Orchestra and the Canadian Armed Forces’ Band of the Ceremonial Guard, and has performed in many venues throughout Canada and the United States. Representing students on campus, Ryan is an Arts Representative with the UPEI Student Union, President for the UPEI Music Society, a student representative on the Department of Music Faculty Council, and Lead Campus Life Advisor with UPEI Student Affairs. Ryan will be completing his BMus at UPEI in the Spring of 2019.</p>
